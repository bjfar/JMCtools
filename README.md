# JMCtools

Some classes and tools for performing statistical simulations from (and fits to) 
joint distribution functions built from scipy.stats objects.

They provide helpful automation tools for the following analysis pipeline:

1. Combine independent distribution functions into a joint distribution
2. Sample from the joint distribution
3. Construct relationships between abstract model parameters and the parameters of the distribution functions
4. Find maximum likelihood estimators for these parameters (for many samples/trials, in parallel)
5. Construct test statistics
